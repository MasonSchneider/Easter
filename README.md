# Easter
Every year I do a puzzle hunt for my family on Easter. I'll add them to this repo eventually.

## 2018 - Egg Hunt

This puzzle hunt was mostly physical. It included 3 games including a word search, math riddles, and fact quiz (family ages and such). To get the URL to trigger a buzzer inside the basket easter eggs were found and combined to form a URL.

## 2019 - The Box

This puzzle was the year of "the box". It consisted of circuits that unlocked steps of a web-based puzzle when the box was under certain conditions. These included a dark room and switch configurations.

## 2020 - King has Risen

This puzzle is "Tiger King" themed. It includes 4 puzzles that result in a name and a number (new member of the family, my sister's fiance). These answers corresponse to an order the faces are tapped on a website to get to the view to input a final password. This reveals the riddle to find the baskets.
